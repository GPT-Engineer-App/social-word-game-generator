# social-word-game-generator

i want to create a social app, where the user input will be a list of names and their phone numbers, and the output will be a watsapp message to each member of the list, with another name of someone else from this list, and a random word, like "shoes" or "salary". the isea is to have a nice soclial game for meetings, each memeber of the list will need to make the member he recived to say the mentioned word. if he will do it he will earn the other person word and will keep make people say words. the app im trying to create will automate this process.
